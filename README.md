# IBM Data Analyst Labs

This repository contains all the hands-on labs and practice notebooks completed during my journey through the [IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst) on Coursera.

## 🚀 What I've Learned

- Python fundamentals for data analysis
- Pandas for data wrangling and preprocessing
- SQL (DB2/MySQL) for querying relational databases
- Excel for pivot tables and basic analytics
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization
- Linear & polynomial regression using Scikit-learn
- Model evaluation using MSE and R²
- Setting up Jupyter Notebooks and GitHub workflow

## 💡 Notes
This repo is part of my learning journey to become a top 1% Data Analyst on Upwork and freelance in data analysis, visualization, and model building.
It will continue to evolve with more advanced projects and Kaggle notebooks.

🛠️ Feel free to explore, fork, or suggest improvements. I'm always learning!
